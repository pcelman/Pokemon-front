## Introduction
  <br/>
The Videogames project is designed to help users manage and view videogames. It consists of a client-side application built with React and a server-side application built with Express. The client-side application allows users to browse and search for video games, while the server-side application provides the necessary APIs to interact with the database. <br/>
API used: https://rawg.io/

 <br/>
## Installation
 <br/>
To run the Videogames project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/pcelman/Videogames-front.git) and [Backend Repository](https://github.com/pcelman/Videogames-back.git).
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database named videogames.
3. Create an .env file inside the api folder of the backend repository with the following information:
<br/>
<code>
DB_USER=[your PostgreSQL username]
DB_PASSWORD=[your PostgreSQL password]
DB_HOST=localhost
</code>
4. Open a terminal inside the api folder and run the following commands:

* npm install to install the dependencies.
* npm start to start the server.

5. Open another terminal inside the client folder and run the following commands:

* npm install to install the dependencies.
* npm run dev to start the client application.
6. Access the client application by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) in your web browser.

## Configuration
<br/>
The configuration for the Videogames project is stored in the .env file located in the api folder. This file contains the necessary environment variables for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
<br/>

## Usage
<br/>
Once the Videogames project is up and running, you can use the client application to browse and search for video games. The server-side API provides the following endpoints for interacting with the application:
